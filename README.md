# Comparison-between-RNN-LSTM-GRU
This project compares SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU for sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset. It preprocesses text by padding sequences and trains each model to classify reviews as positive or negative. The models' validation accuracy and test performance are evaluated and visualized to determine the most effective RNN architecture.
